## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke serenity and relaxation.
- Background color: Pale grayish lavender (#F0F0F8), very low saturation to maintain minimalist aesthetic.
- Accent color: Light blue (#ADD8E6), used sparingly for interactive elements, offers a soft, complementary contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), chosen for its balance of modernity and readability.
- Emphasize white space to reinforce a sense of 'pausa y serenidad', improve readability, and create a clean, uncluttered design.
- Incorporate simple line icons that symbolize yoga poses, mindfulness, or nature. Use icons sparingly and ensure they complement the minimalist aesthetic.
- Add subtle fade-in effects when scrolling to a new section, but animations should be unobtrusive and support the overall minimalist design.
